<p class="text-info">My old site edymttdev.appspot.com now redirects here. If you entered a specific page, you have to search for it in the new site: I've intentionally done a base redirect to the home page since in future site updates the URLs and sections are likely to change. Sorry for the additional work.</p>

<p>Hi! I'm Eric Miotto and this is my "hub" on the Internet, where I experiment with HTML and I link to my presence on various sites.</p>

<p>You can read my <a href="cv.html">curriculum vitae</a> 
and check out my <a href="syllabus/skills.html">skills</a>. In addition you can consult my <a href="findmeon.html">presence on the internet</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
