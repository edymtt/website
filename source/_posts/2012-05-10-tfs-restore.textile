A brief procedure on how to restore a TFS 2010 backup on a new machine with only the necessary stuff

# install SQL Server 2008 R2
# install TFS using the advanced wizard
** exclude reporting, analysis, sharepoint
** set up the desired service user for TFS

# do not start any GUI
# open a command prompt -- that is @cmd.exe@
# stop the TFS service with @TFSServiceControl quiesce@
# launch @TFSConfig PrepSQL /SQLInstance: ServerName@, replacing @ServerName@ with the name of the SQL Server instance you installed on the first step
# launch @TFSConfig RemapDBS /DatabaseName:servername;TFS_Configuration /SQLInstances:servername /Continue@
# if it doesn't work launch again
# launch @TFSConfig Accounts /ResetOwner /SQLInstance: ServerName /DatabaseName: DatabaseName@
# launch @TFSConfig Accounts /add /AccountType:ApplicationTier /account: AccountName /SQLInstance: ServerName /DatabaseName: DatabaseName@
# launch @TFSConfig registerDB /SQLInstance: ServerName /DatabaseName: DatabaseName@
# launch @tfsservicecontrol unquiesce@
# client machine do not need any further reconfiguration, even if the server name changed, since they pick up the TFS server based on GUID
