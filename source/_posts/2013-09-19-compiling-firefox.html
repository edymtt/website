<p>I'll try to document how to set up OS X to compile Firefox -- in order to have all the relevant links in one place.
Please note that his information might became obsolete, please check the date of the post</p>

<ul>
	<li>Setup the environment with the bootstrap script (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/Build_Instructions/Mac_OS_X_Prerequisites">link in MDN</a>)</li>
	<ul>
	  <li>Python will be installed from Homebrew (since Python >= 2.7.3 is required). If link fails because pip executables will be overwritten, uninstall pip using pip uninstall pip (sudo may be needed)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>build with mach</li>
    <ul>
    	<li>the tool is refined, presenting clear feedback about progress</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
