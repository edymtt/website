<p>I've acquired the domain edymtt.io and I'm using it to serve my website and my cv. My website is now accessible from <a href="http://www.edymtt.io">http://www.edymtt.io</a> and my HTML CV from <a href="http://cv.edymtt.io">http://cv.edymtt.io</a>.</p>

<p>Since Google App Engine does not have a clear way to associate a custom domain with a site, I've now switched to Heroku -- you should notice any difference in site behavior.</p>
