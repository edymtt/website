Recently I had to communicate via SFTP with an embedded device running Linux from a .NET program.

I've started using "http://sshnet.codeplex.com/":SSHNET . The library is simple to use and worked, but I've experienced problem in uploading files in some scenario -- basically the file was uploaded but the SSH server often refused to answer, hanging the .NET program.

I've then switched to "http://www.chilkatsoft.com/ssh-sftp-component.asp":Chilkat, but I've experienced the problem again, although less frequently and without any program hang.

Finally, thanks to some wise suggestions, I've decided to use  "http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/":Putty, in particular psftp. I have to invoke it using Process.Start, but it worked flawlessly.

I wonder the cause of this behaviour. Maybe a day...
