I've started playing with "Thunderbird":https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird .
I'll try to put my experiments in the form of exercises for two reasons:

* avoid to rehash the existing documentation;
* force me to think about what I'm doing, without following instructions literally.

So here we go!

# compile the development version of Thunderbird under OS X 10.7 (done)
# compile the development version of Thunderbird under Fedora 17 (done)
# compile the development version of Thunderbird under Windows (done)
# compile Thunderbird 13.0.1
** it is better done from tarball, but can be done from @comm-release@?
# configure parallel build of Thunderbird (e.g. 4 threads for dual core) (done on OS X)
# use pymake under Windows
# improve compilation times
## disable tests
## use ccache
## understand incremental build
# follow IRC channel (possibly with Thunderbird Daily :-) )
# replicate Mozilla build infrastructure
## BuildBot
## multiple architecture
## Tinderboxpushlog
