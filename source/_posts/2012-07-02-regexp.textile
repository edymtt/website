You can find the @sed@ scripts in this "GitHub repository":https://github.com/edymtt/regex

*Problem* Substitute all the occurences of 

bc. Public <something> as <type>

with

bc. Public Readonly Property <something> as <type>
  Get
    Return _source.<something>
  end Get
End Property

*Solution* Under Visual Studio, in the Find/Replace dialog, the match pattern is

bc. Public {[^ ]+} as {.#}\n

The replace pattern is

bc. Public Readonly Property \1 as \2 \ Get \n Return _source\.\1 \n End Get \n End Property

Under @sed@ on OS X you need this expression

bc. s:Public \([^ ][^ ]*\) as \(.*\):Public Readonly Property \1 As \2\
  Get\
    Return _source\.\1\
  End Get\
End Property\
:

The interesting part is that you cannot use @\+@ to match one or more character, it seems that
this is a GNU extension and it is not found in the version shipped in OS X (derived from the one
in FreeBSD).

The exercise is contained in the @property@ folder.
