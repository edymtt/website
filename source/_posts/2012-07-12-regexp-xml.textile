You can find the @sed@ scripts in this "GitHub repository":https://github.com/edymtt/regex

*Problem* Try to render human-readable a one-line XML

*Solution* This can be done in steps:
# insert new line character after the XML declaration
# insert new line character after the DOCTYPE declaration
# insert new line character after an empty element
# insert new line character after an end element

The tricky part is to insert new line characters between start elements. In the way @sed@ works,
it seems it cannot work on superimposed matches, so to break more than stow start elements. I work around
this problem by calling @sed@ multiple times until the input is the same of the output (i.e. no more substitution possible).
Probably this isn't the best solution if the input file is huge.

The exercise is container in the @xml@ folder.
