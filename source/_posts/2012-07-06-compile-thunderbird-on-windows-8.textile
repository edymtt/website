**Please note that these instructions are obsolete and I keep them for historical reasons, for compilation on Windows 8 you should refer to "these instructions":https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/Build_Instructions/Windows_Prerequisites on Mozilla Developer Network**

# download Visual C++ Express 2010
# apply Visual Studio 2010 SP1
# install Windows 8 SDK (this includes SDK 7.0A)
# install DirectX SDK (this will install .NET 2.0/3.5 alongside)
# install MozillaBuild
# start MozillaBuild from @start-msvc10.bat@
# follow the instructions to obtain the Daily executable
